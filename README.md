# 📰 Fake News Detection System

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Fake News Detection System** built using Python and Google Colab.  
The goal is to classify news articles as **real** or **fake** based on their content.  

It applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **Machine Learning models** to analyze datasets of news headlines/articles and predict authenticity.

## 🚀 Run on Google Colab
You can open and run the notebook directly in Colab:

## ⚙️ Features
- Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization)  
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF / Count Vectorizer  
- Model training using ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.)  
- Accuracy evaluation and prediction of news authenticity  

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `project1.ipynb` → Main Colab notebook containing the Fake News Detection implementation  
- `README.md` → Documentation  

*(Datasets are not included here due to size, but can be linked if required.)*
